## How to Use

To open the documentation for the API, just run the following command:

This will open a local web server with the complete documentation for each class.

Hereâ€™s a sample of how to use them:

```
import Verse from '../../tupos/models/verse'
const verse = await Verse.getOne('EPH.3.20', 116)
console.log(verse.reference.human, verse.content)
```
